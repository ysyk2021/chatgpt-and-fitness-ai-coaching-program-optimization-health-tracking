In this chapter, we will provide an overview of fitness coaching and health tracking.

What is Fitness Coaching?
-------------------------

Fitness coaching involves providing personalized guidance and support to individuals in achieving their fitness goals. This may include creating workout plans, providing nutrition advice, and offering motivation and accountability. The goal of fitness coaching is to help individuals improve their overall health and well-being through physical activity and healthy habits.

Fitness coaching can take many forms, including personal training, group fitness classes, online coaching, and DIY coaching. Personal training involves one-on-one sessions with a personal trainer who provides customized guidance and support based on the individual's fitness goals and needs. Group fitness classes typically involve a structured workout led by an instructor and attended by multiple participants with similar fitness goals. Online coaching involves receiving personalized guidance and support from a coach or trainer through online platforms such as video conferencing or messaging apps. DIY coaching involves creating a personalized fitness plan and implementing it without the guidance of a coach or trainer.

What is Health Tracking?
------------------------

Health tracking involves monitoring various metrics such as activity levels, nutrition habits, and health indicators to track progress towards fitness goals. The goal of health tracking is to provide individuals with feedback on their daily activity levels and encourage healthy habits.

There are several types of health tracking techniques used today, including wearable devices, mobile apps, medical monitoring devices, and self-reporting. Wearable devices, such as Fitbit and Apple Watch, can track various metrics such as steps taken, calories burned, and heart rate. Mobile apps allow users to track their food intake, water consumption, and exercise routines, among other things. Medical monitoring devices monitor vital signs such as blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and oxygen saturation. Self-reporting involves users manually recording data about their diet, exercise, and overall health.
